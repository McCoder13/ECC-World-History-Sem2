                <p id="gen1">The war was fought on multiple fronts, with the Western Front in France and Belgium being the most widely recognized. It was marked by trench warfare, where soldiers lived in severe conditions for months at a time, exposed to inclement weather and the constant threat of death. Militaries also developed new technologies for fighting such as machine guns, poison gas, and tanks which greatly intensified the lethality of the fighting. 

                </p>
                <p id="gen2">The conflict finally came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which imposed harsh reparations on Germany and Austria-Hungary, and created new nations from the former empires of Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. 
                </p>
                <p id="gen3">World War I also led to significant changes in the international order, with the League of Nations being established to promote international cooperation and prevent future wars, especially a second world war. However, the harsh terms of the treaty and the unresolved tensions between nations would contribute to the outbreak of World War II two decades later.

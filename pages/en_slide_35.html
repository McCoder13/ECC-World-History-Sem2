                <p id="gen1">For forty-five years, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a standoff that had the potential to nearly end the world. When the United States dropped the atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II, they unleashed a new method of war on the world. Although the United States won the atomic race, other countries were not far behind, as the Soviets (with a lot of help from spies in the United States) developed their own atomic weapon in 1949. They fought using proxy wars and propaganda, both racing to have the edge with superior weapons.
                </p>
                <p id="gen2">Fueling the tension between the two nations was competition for global influence, differing approaches to economic development, and mutual distrust. The United States implemented a policy of containment, seeking to limit the spread of communism, while the Soviet Union sought to spread its ideology throughout the world. 
                </p>
                <p id="gen3">Despite several very close calls, no shot was ever directly fired during the Cold War which ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

                <h3>Asia, Africa, Americas, and Europe</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Asia saw many inventions and lifestyles from many countries. India had cities with sewer systems and roads with homes and stores built alongside. Religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism become very popular. Dynasties in China ruled and invented many items used today. Africa had many different tribes with hundreds of unique languages and lifestyles. Religion tended to vary from tribe to tribe with people worshiping everything from rocks to the sky. In the Americas tribes in Northern America lived in small villages while Central and South America saw great cities and civilizations constructed. Governments were created as part of those civilizations. Europeans, especially Greeks, typically looked down on other nations and people they did not understand. Puzzling creations have been found from ancient times, like Stonehedge, that are impressive feats of construction for the time but have an unknown use. Constant wars were being waged throughout Europe as nations rose and fell vying for power, as power struggle was a constant theme throughout history.</p>

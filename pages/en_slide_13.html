                <h3>Europe After Rome</h3>
                <p id="gen1">After Rome fell, the Church grew so much that the Roman Catholic Church became the main power in Europe. Unfortunately, Islam started gaining ground, influencing many people, especially in Arab countries.</p>
                <p id="gen2">As Europe became divided, governmental structures of nations became more focused on kings, queens, and nobles. The succession of power was based on bloodline, which also determined nearly every position of power or rank. A strict social system separated lower-class groups from the higher class, the highest being royalty, and the lower being the peasants of the small villages.</p>
                <p id="gen3">Something that became a constant in Europe in the 500 years after the fall of Rome is war. War was constantly being waged by tribes or nations over power, prestige, or resources. This caused the political geography of Europe to be constantly changing throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

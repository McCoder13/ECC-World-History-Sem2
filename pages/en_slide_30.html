                <p id="gen1">Sigmund Freud, born in 1856 in Moravia (now the Czech Republic), was an atheist like Karl Marx, even going so far as to say that religion is, “a universal obsessional neurosis.” He believed that pleasure was the driving force behind every action a human makes. The idea he came up with was that a person’s personality was composed of three parts, ego, superego, and id. Based on this, he said that if one could identify what those desires may be, it would give them a happy and productive life. These theories can be combated in several ways. Firstly, without a foundation in Christ, anything Marx wrote or said regarding these topics would be inheritably flawed since it would contradict the Bible. Secondly, pleasure does not control every action made by a person. Someone sacrificing themselves for another or giving up everything to assist a stranger would not be driven by pleasure to do those actions. Thirdly, the desire for pleasure is not a healthy mindset all of the time. Even though Marx does not blatantly say that there is no sin, because he rejected God, the Bible, to him,  was just written by some random person, therefore, making it have no power to determine what was a sin.

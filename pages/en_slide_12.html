                <h3>The End of Rome</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Throughout most of Roman history, the current emperor would choose his son to be his successor. However, when Marcus Aurelius chose Commodus around 180 AD, that system was disregarded so it fell apart. Instead of emperors appointing heirs, generals would fight for power, meaning whoever was the emperor of  Rome just had the biggest army. Even still, some emperors would only last for a few months; and between 234 AD and 284 AD, 26 different emperors ruled, almost all ending in assassination. </p>
                <p id="gen2">Romans had one emperor in 284 AD named Diocletian who brought back some stability to the economy, but he persecuted Christians severely. After him, the Roman Empire was split between the East and the West. Instability continued, another emperor stabilized Rome, and when he died it fell back again. Gradually over time, the strength of Rome dwindled, morals become twisted, and loyalty to the Empire faded. In the end, the Roman Empire fell despite its many achievements and accomplishments.</p>

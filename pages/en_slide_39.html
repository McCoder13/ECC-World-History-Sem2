                <p id="gen1">Christianity's influence has brought about significant changes in how people around the world lived and thought. For example, Christians viewed children differently than pagan cultures did, as Jesus taught the value of children, leading believers to rescue and care for abandoned children. Early Christians opposed abortion, and Christianity's spread led to the world becoming a safer place for children. Christianity also played a part in ending gladiatorial combat and slavery in Europe in the centuries following Christ, although slavery resurfaced later, and Christians again led the fight to end it in the 1800s. Even the humane treatment of prisoners was a result of Christianity's growing influence on the worth of human beings, even those who had been convicted of crimes. Women also gained more rights in society, thanks to Jesusâ€™s teachings of their value.

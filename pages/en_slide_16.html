                <p id="gen1">Beginning in Italy and spreading across Europe, the Renaissance lasted from about the 14th century to the 17th century. Itâ€™s considered to be the bridge between the Middle ages and modern civilization. The Renaissance is most known for its new styles of art, music, and literature, in which the invention of the printing press around the mid-15th century, played a leading role. Internation trade started becoming more crucial for countries' economies, ending the Middle Ages trade guilds formerly popular throughout Europe. Transitioning out of the Middle ages also included most European countries forming a more central nation-state, with the exception of Italy.</p>

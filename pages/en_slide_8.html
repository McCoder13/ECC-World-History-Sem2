                <h3>Overview of Greek History</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Greece can be traced back to the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. They are thought to have been displaced and moved to the Greek peninsula. Greece developed itself into city-states, several of the large ones being Athens and Sparta. City-states would often war with each other. Greece is known for its architecturally massive structures and recording of history. Many famous Greek philosophers came up with ground-breaking discoveries in math and science. Greeks were pagan, worshiping many gods and completely rejecting God. Greece still has a major impact on the world today as one of the most infulencial civilizations of all time.</p>

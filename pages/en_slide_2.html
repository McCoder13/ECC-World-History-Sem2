                <p id="gen1">Contrary to what most "history" books portray, there is no archaeological evidence of cave dwellers giving way to man-made housing. What archaeological evidence (and biblical evidence) shows is nomads existed at the same time as settlements.</p>
                <p id="gen2">Early on, humans created governments, economies, and social systems. The earliest known civilizations show that people were creating, thinking, and advancing from the very beginning.</p>

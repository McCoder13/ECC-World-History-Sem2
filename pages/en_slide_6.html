                <h3>Babylon Conquering Israel</h3>
                <p id="gen1">When Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon conquered Israel, he ordered all but the poorest people to become captives in Babylon. Several of these captives were named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The king ordered officials to choose a number of young men to serve in the court and the aftermentioned captives were among those selected. Before the captives could serve on the court, they had to be trained for three years. Unlike the majority of the other captives part of training, Daniel and his friends choose to only eat vegetables and drink water. They soon began to stand out among the other trainees.</p>
                <p id="gen2">After finishing their training, they were given new Babylonian names, Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Despite becoming high-ranking in position and recognition, they had to put their absolute faith in God many times, even when they might be killed.</p>

                <h3>His Impact</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Jesusâ€™s impact is unmeasurable. Coming to live the life of a man and preaching for 30 years. Performing many miracles, healing people, raising people from the dead, and feeding people. Then betrayed by one of His closest followers (even though He knew it was coming ), and arrested by the Romans. Crucified on the cross, taking on all the sins of the world and becoming separated from God for a moment. Giving the opportunity of eternal life in heaven with our Father to anyone who believes.</p>

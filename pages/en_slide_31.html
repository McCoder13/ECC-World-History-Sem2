                <p id="gen1">The historical event that is commonly known as the First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, was an immense and catastrophic global conflict that involved the major powers of Europe, along with their colonies. It was a war of unparalleled brutality, which resulted in an astonishing number of casualties, with a staggering 8.5 million soldiers and 6.5 million civilians losing their lives.
                </p>
                <p id="gen2">The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June of 1914 was the trigger that sparked the war, setting in motion a complex web of alliances and mobilizations among the major powers. By August, the conflict had engulfed Europe in a wave of fighting and destruction and had started spreading across the globe.

                <p id="gen1">World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945, involved the majority of the world's nations and was fueled by a mix of political, economic, and social factors.
                </p>
                <p id="gen2">The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed harsh reparations on Germany after World War I, was a significant factor that led to the rise of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Nationalism, territorial disputes, and ideological differences also played a role in the outbreak of war.
                </p>
                <p id="gen3">Similar to World War I, this war saw the major development of new technologies, such as tanks, aircraft, and submarines, which revolutionized warfare. However, it also resulted in the mass killing of civilians, including the Holocaust, which saw the systematic murder of six million Jews by the Nazis.

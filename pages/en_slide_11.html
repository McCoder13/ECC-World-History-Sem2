                <h3>Beginning of the Church</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Before Jesus ascended back up into heaven, He gave the disciples the Great Commission, <em>“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”</em> The coming of the Holy Spirit and the start of the church on the Day of Pentecost was one of the most significant events in all of human history.  When Peter preached the gospel for the first time, three thousand people believed. By the end of the book of Acts, about thirty years after the miracle in Jerusalem, the gospel was already getting preaching in the capital of the Roman Empire. </p>

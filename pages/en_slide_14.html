                <h3>Crusades</h3>
                <p id="gen1">The Crusades were fueled by the desire to recapture Jerusalem and Palestine, which was under Muslim control. Pope Urban II organized the first Crusaders in 1095 AD and the First Crusade began in 1096 AD. It started off with victories in Asia Minor and Syria and in 1099, they captured Jerusalem. They also created several Crusader states in Palestine and Syria that lasted nearly two hundred years.</p>
                <p id="gen2">Then one of the states fell sparking the Second Crusade. However, this Crusade was much less successful than the first, as it was defeated and scattered across Asia Minor. In 1187 AD, a Muslim warrior named Saladin recaptured Jerusalem.</p>
                <p id="gen3">A Third Crusade, this time led by Richard I (lionheart) of England, lasted from 1189 AD to 1192 AD. It too failed at capturing Jerusalem; however, Richard I did manage to negotiate a deal to allow Christians to visit the city under Muslim control.</p>
                <p id="gen4">Last, but not least, a Fourth Crusade, supported by merchants from Italy, attempted to attack Constantinople. This only slightly weakened it and did not complete the goal of the Crusade. Overall, the original mission of the Crusades was a failure because Jersulem and the Holy land remained in Muslim control.</p>

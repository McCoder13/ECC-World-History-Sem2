                <p id="gen1">Less than twenty years after Augustus died, a teacher emerged among the Jews and began to preach some amazing things. Jesus Christ told His followers that they were the salt of the earth and the light of the world, which was an incredible perspective given that they were just a small group in a far-off corner of the Empire. After Jesus was crucified and resurrected, He commissioned His disciples to go and proclaim the good news of God's reconciliation to the world. Although thousands of people accepted this message, existing leaders felt threatened and repeatedly attacked believers, leading to persecution in the Roman Empire.

                <h3>The Beginning of Israel</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Abram was born to Terah, a Shemite. Before arriving at Haran, Abram was called by God to move to the foreign land of Cannan. Abram obeyed God and demonstrated his faith in the Lord, leaving behind his family’s background of pagan idols and gods.</p>
                <p id="gen2">When Abram arrived at Cannan, God made a covenant with him. Abram was shown the stars in the sky and God told him his descendants would be as numerous as the them because he was the start of the nation of Israel. God changed Abram’s name to Abraham and Sarai’s name (Abraham’s wife) to Sarah. Circumcision of male children was instituted as a sign of God’s covenant.</p>
                <p id="gen3">However, Abraham still had no children and Sarah was already ninety years old. He and his wife were skeptical of whether they could still bear a child. Despite their doubts, God gave Abraham and Sarah a son, Issac, which started the fulfillment of His promise.</p>

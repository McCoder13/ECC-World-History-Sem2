                <p id="gen1">In 14 AD, when Augustus Caesar passed away, the world was predominantly pagan, with pagan temples existing in cities across the Roman Empire. People from various regions around the world, such as Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, also adhered to pagan beliefs. The common belief was that many gods existed in the heavens, and humans were merely pawns in the gods' actions, with immorality being accepted in some religions. Only Israel had detailed knowledge of God, and only a few people at that time had a concept of the one true God.

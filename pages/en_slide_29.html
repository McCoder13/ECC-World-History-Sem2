                <p id="gen1">Charles Darwin, born in 1809 in England, is best known for his theories on evolution and natural selection. He first published his theories on natural selection in 1859 in a book titled, “Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or, the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Upon release, although highly controversial, sold very well and he published many more books with other theories he had developed such as, “The Origin of Species” and “Descent of Man.” In complete contradiction with the Bible, Darwin claimed that animals and humans shared a common ancestor and evolved into completely different species over time. Although humans and animals share many of the same characteristics, mouth, nose, stomach, and liver, they do not mean that we came from the same ancestor as a chimpanzee, but rather that we share a common Designer who designed and created all of creation. Even though Darwin’s theories have very little evidence supporting them, and much more evidence against them, his theories have become accepted as fact among the majority of scientists, schools, and general media.

                <h3>Kings of Israel</h3>
                <p id="gen1">To set Israel apart as God’s special people, He wanted Israel to not have a human king but directly rule Himself. Despite many warnings about how a human king would treat them (all turn out to be true), Israel demanded that God give them a king who they could see. So God gave them Saul.</p>
                <p id="gen2">Saul started well but soon strayed from God causing Him to replace Saul with David. David was one of Israel’s most faithful kings; although not perfect, followed God for the entirety of his reign over Israel. Then David’s son Solomon took over the throne. He was also mostly faithful to God, building the temple and being blessed with wisdom not seen before or after him, which made Israel very rich and powerful.</p>
                <p id="gen3">Unfortunately, the golden age of Israel would come to an end when Solomon’s son Rehoboam came to power. He strayed from God causing God to split Israel between him and Jeroboam, dividing Israel into two separate nations, Israel and Judea.</p>

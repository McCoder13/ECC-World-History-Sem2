                <p id="gen1">Around the time of the Reformation, Europeans began to make monumental advances in exploring beyond the boundaries of the “known world". This sudden urge to explore was fueled by Marco Polo’s exploration and significantly improved navigation and exploration techniques. Countries like England, Spain, France, and the Netherlands sent explorers to create new colonies and expand their borders. They also wanted to find new trade routes, especially to discover if traveling west would reach Asia fast than sailing around Africa.

                <p id="gen2">The Age of Exploration brought the discovery of new lands, the colonization of the Americas, a massive increase in international trade, new products and goods, and many advances in science and technology. World powers shifted during this time, countries were building up more wealth and territories, and Italy’s status as a global trade market was diminished, allowing Britain to become the world superpower in nearly every category by the late 1700s.</p>

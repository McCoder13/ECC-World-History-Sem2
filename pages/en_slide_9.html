                <h3>Roman History</h3>
                <p id="gen1">Many legends about the origins of the Roman Empire have been created, some more famous than others; however, the true start of the Roman Empire (as best as historians and archaeologists can tell) was in central Italy. They started as simple farmers and grew into the city of Rome, a city-state that was the capital of the Roman Empire. Romans created a form of government called a republic and its basis infulenced many countries' systems of government afterward. Romans developed complex government structures and organizations of social status. They created marvels of engineering that still amaze architects today. At the height of the Roman Empire, they had conquered a large portion of Europe, parts of Africa, and Asia; and were the most powerful nation of the time period. But the Roman Republic would not last as it eventually turned into a dictatorship.</p>
